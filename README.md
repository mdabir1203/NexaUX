## 💡 What is NexaUX?

NexaUX is **not a code library**. It is a **battle-tested collection of AI prompts** written specifically to instruct AI coding agents — like **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude**, **Windsurf**, **Codeium**, and others — to do the heavy lifting for you.

Each prompt is a precise, opinionated brief that tells the AI agent exactly what to build, what statistics to follow, and how to enhance your existing website — layer by layer — without rebuilding it from scratch.

```
You write nothing.
You paste a prompt into your AI agent.
The agent writes your code.
You review, approve, and ship.
```

---

<br/>

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1 — Pick Your AI Agent

NexaUX prompts work with any of these:

| Agent | Where to Paste the Prompt |
|---|---|
| **Cursor** | `Ctrl+L` → Chat panel → Paste prompt |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Copilot Chat sidebar → Paste prompt |
| **Claude** | claude.ai or Claude in your IDE → Paste prompt |
| **Windsurf (Codeium)** | Cascade chat panel → Paste prompt |
| **Zed AI** | AI inline assistant → Paste prompt |
| **Any other AI IDE** | Open the chat / agent panel → Paste prompt |

### Step 2 — Open Your Project

Open your existing website project in your AI-powered IDE. The prompts are written to **enhance what you already have** — not replace it.

### Step 3 — Paste a Prompt

Choose a prompt from the library below, copy it, and paste it into your AI agent's chat. The agent reads your codebase and applies the changes automatically.

### Step 4 — Review & Ship

Review the AI's output, request adjustments if needed, and push to production.
